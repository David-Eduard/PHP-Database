&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have successfully passed the login page you will be sent to the page where you can view your resume. Here you will find contact details, social media as well as information about me and my experience. There are functional buttons that send you directly to the contact pages. On top of all this there is also a "Markers" button that sends you to a page where all the countries I have visited are marked.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Here you can find all the cities we visited, with access through google maps. Besides that there are also two back and log out buttons that you can use to go back to your cv or log out.

&nbsp; &nbsp; All these pages are linked to a database created in MySql. This database has 2 tables: users, points. In the users table are stored all the users who create an account with a username and a password. In the points table are the names of the countries we have been in and their coordinates.
